      <description>Marooned in Realtime is a well written Sci-Fi murder mystery based in an era 50 million years from now. In this novel, Vernor Vinge presents an unconventional view of rather conventional Sci-Fi ideas like time travel, technological singularity, immortality etc. And he does so as innovatively as convincingly.
There are only about 300 humans left on Earth and there are mixed opinions about what may have happened that led to the disappearance of mankind.</description>
