      <description>So, it started with the thought of publishing some of the photos, I managed to click, online. The task would involve going thru the usual process of: Copy photos form my camera to my computer. Then watermark them. Then, possibly, add a frame around the image and finally publish to my favorite photo sharing service.
Since, I have been uploading some of my photos to flickr already, I needed a good way to batch edit my photos and push them to flickr.</description>
